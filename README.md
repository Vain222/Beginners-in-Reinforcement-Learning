# Why this project?
Beginners who are new to reinforcement learning, Python implementation of some reinforcement learning algorithms, record my own learning process at the same time

# Getting Started
First, clone this repository and navigate into its directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Vain222/Beginners-in-Reinforcement-Learning.git
cd Beginners-in-Reinforcement-Learning
pip install -v -e . 
```
Uninstall this project:
```shell
pip uninstall BIRL
```

# training
You can use free computing resources from [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to train the model.

<!-- The following two files [Colab.ipynb](vce/tools/Kaggle.ipynb) and [Colab_TPU.ipynb](vce/tools/Colab_TPU.ipynb) can be directly applied. The first is the gpu version of the training file, and the second is the tpu version of the training file. -->
